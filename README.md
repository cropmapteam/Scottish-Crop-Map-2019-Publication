# Random Forest Model
The `random_forest` branch shows code used to create the random forest model and its predictions. This has been split into 5 different sections:

* Interpolating & Preparing Data - code to deal with missing data and format the zonal statistics dataset
* Random Forest Modelling - code to create the model
* Model Improvements & Variable Selection - comments about changes made to the model and code used for different selection methods
* Running Code on Reduced Zonal Data - code to run the model on the reduced dataset
* Probability Cut-Off on Predictions - code to deal with overestimation by using class probabilities on model predictions
