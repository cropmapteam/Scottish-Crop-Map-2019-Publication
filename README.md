# Scottish-Crop-Map-2019-Publication
Within this repository you will find the code used to produce zonal statistics from radar images and the code used to perform random forest models on those statistics. 

The Experimental Statistics ‘Crop Map of Scotland’ is a map of all the agricultural fields in Scotland categorised into the likely main crop types which were grown in 2019. The statistics from the map are designated as ‘experimental’ because the methods used to assign the crop types are novel and are under review.

This repository contains the code used to develop methods and statistics for the first iteration of the Scottish Crop Map field predictions for 2019.
